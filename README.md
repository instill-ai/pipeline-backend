[![Integration Test](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/actions/workflows/integration-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/actions/workflows/integration-test.yml)

`pipeline-backend` manages all pipeline resources within [Versatile Data
Pipeline (VDP)](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp) to streamline data from the
start component, through AI/Data/Application components and to the end
component.

## Concepts

### Pipeline

In **ðŸ’§ Instill VDP**, a pipeline is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) consisting
of multiple **components**.

```mermaid

s[Trigger] --> c1[OpenAI Component]
c1 --> c2[Stability AI Component]
c1 --> c3[MySQL Component]
c1 --> e[Response]
c2 --> e
```

### Component

A **Component** serves as an essential building block within a **Pipeline**.

See [the `component` package documentation](./pkg/component/README.md) for more
details.

### Recipe

A **pipeline recipe** specifies how components are configured and how they are
interconnected.

Recipes are defined in YAML language:

```yaml
variable:
  # pipeline input fields
output:
  # pipeline output fields
component:
  <component-id>:
    type: <component-definition-id>
    task: <task-id>
    input:
      # values for the input fields
    condition: <condition> # conditional statement to execute or bypass the component
    setup: <setup> # setup specification values required in AI, Data and Application components
```

The [component development
guide](./pkg/component/CONTRIBUTING.md#example-recipe) contains a full example
recipe.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant u as User
participant gw as api-gateway
participant p as pipeline-backend
participant db as pipeline-db

u ->> gw: POST /users/<user>/pipelines
gw ->> p: forward
p ->> db: Store pipeline and its recipe
```

### Trigger

When a pipeline is triggered, the DAG will be computed in order to execute
components in topological order.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

participant u as User
participant gw as api-gateway
participant p as pipeline-backend
participant db as pipeline-db
participant c as component

u ->> gw: POST /users/<user>/pipelines/<pipeline-id>/trigger
gw ->> p: forward
p ->> db: Get recipe
db ->> p: Recipe
loop over topological order of components
    p->>c: ExecuteWithValidation
end
```
