# test

# TEST_DBHOST and TEST_DBNAME are used to initialize a separate database for
# coverage tests. In general, test queries will be run within a transaction
# that will be rolled back on cleanup, but there might be cases where this
# isn't possible (e.g. lock tests). We want to keep these queries isolated from
# the main database.
