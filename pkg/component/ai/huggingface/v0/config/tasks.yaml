TASK_TOKEN_CLASSIFICATION:
  shortDescription: Token classification is a natural language understanding task in which a label is assigned to some tokens in a text.
  description: Token classification is a natural language understanding task in which a label is assigned to some tokens in a text. Some popular token classification
    subtasks are Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging. NER models could be trained to identify specific entities in a text, such
    as dates, individuals and places; and PoS tagging would identify, for example, which words in a text are verbs, nouns, and punctuation marks.

              simple: Entities are grouped according to the default schema (B-, I- tags get merged when the tag is similar).
              first: Same as the simple strategy except words cannot end up with different tags. Words will use the tag of the first token when there is ambiguity.
              average: Same as the simple strategy except words cannot end up with different tags. Scores are averaged across tokens and then the maximum label is applied.
              max: Same as the simple strategy except words cannot end up with different tags. Word entity will be the token with the maximum score.
