## Release Stage

`Alpha`



## Configuration

The component definition and tasks are defined in the [definition.yaml](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/blob/main/pkg/component/ai/huggingface/v0/config/definition.yaml) and [tasks.yaml](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/blob/main/pkg/component/ai/huggingface/v0/config/tasks.yaml) files respectively.




## Setup


In order to communicate with Hugging Face, the following connection details need to be
provided. You may specify them directly in a pipeline recipe as key-value pairs
within the component's `setup` block, or you can create a **Connection** from
the [**Integration Settings**](https://www.instill.tech/docs/vdp/integration)
page and reference the whole `setup` as `setup:
${connection.<my-connection-id>}`.

## Supported Tasks

### Text Generation

Generating text is the task of producing new text. These models can, for example, fill in incomplete text or paraphrase.

<h4 id="text-generation-parameters">Parameters</h4>

Parameters.

<div class="markdown-col-no-wrap" data-col-1 data-col-2>

| Field | Field ID | Format | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do Sample | `do-sample` | boolean | Whether or not to use sampling, use greedy decoding otherwise.  |
| Max New Tokens | `max-new-tokens` | integer | The amount of new tokens to be generated, this does not include the input length it is a estimate of the size of generated text you want. Each new tokens slows down the request, so look for balance between response times and length of text generated.  |
| Max Time | `max-time` | number | The amount of time in seconds that the query should take maximum. Network can cause some overhead so it will be a soft limit. Use that in combination with max-new-tokens for best results.  |
| Num Return Sequences | `num-return-sequences` | integer | The number of proposition you want to be returned.  |
| Repetition Penalty | `repetition-penalty` | number | The more a token is used within generation the more it is penalized to not be picked in successive generation passes.  |
| Return Full Text | `return-full-text` | boolean | If set to False, the return results will not contain the original query making it easier for prompting.  |
| Temperature | `temperature` | number | The temperature of the sampling operation. 1 means regular sampling, 0 means always take the highest score, 100.0 is getting closer to uniform probability.  |
| Top K | `top-k` | integer | Integer to define the top tokens considered within the sample operation to create new text.  |
| Top P | `top-p` | number | Float to define the tokens that are within the sample operation of text generation. Add tokens in the sample for more probable to least probable until the sum of the probabilities is greater than top-p.  |

| Use Cache | `use-cache` | boolean | There is a cache layer on the inference API to speedup requests we have already seen.

| Wait For Model | `wait-for-model` | boolean | If the model is not ready, wait for it instead of receiving 503. It limits the number of requests required to get your inference done. It is advised to only set this flag to true after receiving a 503 error as it will limit hanging in your application to known places.  |

### Token Classification

Token classification is a natural language understanding task in which a label is assigned to some tokens in a text. Some popular token classification subtasks are Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging. NER models could be trained to identify specific entities in a text, such as dates, individuals and places; and PoS tagging would identify, for example, which words in a text are verbs, nouns, and punctuation marks.

### Sentence Similarity

Sentence Similarity is the task of determining how similar two texts are. Sentence similarity models convert input texts into vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic information and calculate how close (similar) they are between them. This task is particularly useful for information retrieval and clustering/grouping.

| Use Cache | `use-cache` | boolean | There is a cache layer on the inference API to speedup requests we have already seen. Most models can use those results as is as models are deterministic (meaning the results will be the same anyway). However if you use a non deterministic model, you can set this parameter to prevent the caching mechanism from being used resulting in a real new query.  |
| Wait For Model | `wait-for-model` | boolean | If the model is not ready, wait for it instead of receiving 503. It limits the number of requests required to get your inference done. It is advised to only set this flag to true after receiving a 503 error as it will limit hanging in your application to known places.  |

### Image Classification

Image classification is the task of assigning a label or class to an entire image. Images are expected to have only one class for each image. Image classification models take an image as input and return a prediction about which class the image belongs to.
