## Release Stage

`Alpha`



## Configuration

The component definition and tasks are defined in the [definition.yaml](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/blob/main/pkg/component/ai/huggingface/v0/config/definition.yaml) and [tasks.yaml](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/blob/main/pkg/component/ai/huggingface/v0/config/tasks.yaml) files respectively.




## Setup


In order to communicate with Hugging Face, the following connection details need to be
provided. You may specify them directly in a pipeline recipe as key-value pairs
within the component's `setup` block, or you can create a **Connection** from
the [**Integration Settings**](https://docs.instill-ai.com/docs/set-up-component)
page and reference the whole `setup` as `setup:
${connection.<my-connection-id>}`.

## Supported Tasks

### Text Generation

Generating text is the task of producing new text. These models can, for example, fill in incomplete text or paraphrase.

| Max New Tokens | `max-new-tokens` | integer | The amount of new tokens to be generated, this does not include the input length it is a estimate of the size of generated text you want. Each new tokens slows down the request, so look for balance between response times and length of text generated. |

| Repetition Penalty | `repetition-penalty` | number | The more a token is used within generation the more it is penalized to not be picked in successive generation passes. |
| Return Full Text | `return-full-text` | boolean | If set to False, the return results will not contain the original query making it easier for prompting. |
| Temperature | `temperature` | number | The temperature of the sampling operation. 1 means regular sampling, 0 means always take the highest score, 100.0 is getting closer to uniform probability. |
| Top K | `top-k` | integer | Integer to define the top tokens considered within the sample operation to create new text. |

### Fill Mask

### Token Classification

Token classification is a natural language understanding task in which a label is assigned to some tokens in a text. Some popular token classification subtasks are Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging. NER models could be trained to identify specific entities in a text, such as dates, individuals and places; and PoS tagging would identify, for example, which words in a text are verbs, nouns, and punctuation marks.

average: Same as the simple strategy except words cannot end up with different tags. Scores are averaged across tokens and then the maximum label is applied.

max: Same as the simple strategy except words cannot end up with different tags. Word entity will be the token with the maximum score. |

### Sentence Similarity

Sentence Similarity is the task of determining how similar two texts are. Sentence similarity models convert input texts into vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic information and calculate how close (similar) they are between them. This task is particularly useful for information retrieval and clustering/grouping.
