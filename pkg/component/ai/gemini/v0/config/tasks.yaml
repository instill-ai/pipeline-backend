          A parameter that controls the randomness and creativity of a large language model's output by adjusting the probability of the next
          word it chooses. A low temperature (e.g., near 0) produces more deterministic, focused, and consistent text, while a high temperature (e.g., near

        description: >-
          A text generation parameter that limits the selection of the next token to the K most probable tokens,  discarding the rest to control randomness
          and maintain coherence. By specifying a fixed number of top tokens,  `top-k` acts as a "safety net," preventing nonsensical choices, but a small
          K can also stifle creativity  and lead to repetitive outputs. It is often used in conjunction with other parameters like temperature and  `top-p`
          to fine-tune the LLM's output.  Note that OpenAI and Mistral models don't have the `top-k` exposed.
        type: integer
      top-p:
        uiOrder: 10
        title: Top-P
        description: >-
          A parameter, also known as nucleus sampling, that controls the randomness and creativity of  the generated text by selecting a dynamic subset
          of tokens. It works by sorting all possible  next tokens by their probability, and then summing their probabilities from highest to lowest  until
          the cumulative sum reaches the specified `top-p` value (a number between 0 and 1).
          The model then randomly selects the next token only from this "nucleus" of high-probability  tokens. A higher `top-p` value creates a larger,
          more diverse set of possible words, leading  to more creative and potentially unpredictable output, while a lower `top-p` value restricts  the
          choice to a smaller, more focused set of highly probable words, resulting in more factual  and conservative output.
