# Contributing Guidelines

## Introduction

This document will guide you through the steps to contribute with a new
component. You'll add and test an operator that takes a string `target` as input
and returns a `"Hello, ${target}!"` string as the component output

In order to add a new component, you need to:
- Define the component configuration. This will determine the tasks that can be
  performed by the component and their input and output parameters. The
  console frontend will use the configuration files to render the component
  in the pipeline editor page.
- Implement the component interfaces so `pipeline-backend` can execute the
  component without knowing its implementation details.
- Initialize the component, i.e., include the implementation of the component
  interfaces as a dependency in the `pipeline-backend` execution.

### Prerequisites

This guide builds on top of other documents:

- `pipeline-backend`'s [README](../../README.md) explains the basic concepts in
  the VDP domain.
- `component`'s [README](./README.md) digs deeper into the **Component** entity,
  its structure and functionalities.
- The repository's [contribution guidelines](../../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  document the conventions you'll need to follow when contributing to this
  repository. They also contain a guide on how to set your development
  environment, in case you want to [see your component in
  action](#use-the-component-in-vdp).
- If you find yourself wanting to know more, visit the [Instill
  Docs](https://www.instill.tech/docs).

### Create the component package

```sh
$ cd $MY_WORKSPACE/pipeline-backend/pkg/component
$ mkdir -p operator/hello/v0 && cd $_
```

Components are isolated in their own packages under their component type (`ai`,
`data`, `application`, etc.).  The package is versioned so, in case a breaking
change needs to be introduced (e.g. supporting a new major version in a vendor
API), existing pipelines using the previous version of the component can keep
being triggered.

At the end of this guide, this will be the structure of the package:

```
operator/hello/v0
 ├──.compogen
 │  └──extra-bottom.mdx
 ├──assets
 │  └──hello.svg
 ├──config
 │  ├──definition.json
 │  └──tasks.json
 ├──main.go
 ├──main_test.go
 └──README.mdx
 ```

### Add the configuration files

Create a `config` directory and add the files `definition.json`, `tasks.json`,
and `setup.json` (optional). Together, these files define the behavior of the
component.

#### `definition.json`

The `definition.json` file describes the high-level information of the
component.

```json
{
  "id": "hello",
  "uid": "e05d3d71-779c-45f8-904d-e90a050ca3b2",
  "title": "Hello",
  "type": "COMPONENT_TYPE_OPERATOR",
  "description": "'Hello, world' operator used as a template for adding components",
  "spec": {},
  "availableTasks": [
    "TASK_GREET"
  ],
  "documentationUrl": "https://www.instill.tech/docs/component/operator/hello",
  "icon": "assets/hello.svg",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "sourceUrl": "https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/pkg/component/blob/main/operator/hello/v0",
  "releaseStage": "RELEASE_STAGE_ALPHA",
  "public": true
}
```

This file defines the component properties:

- **`id`** is the ID of the component. It must be unique.
- **`uid`** is a UUID string that must not be already taken by another
  component. Once it is set, it must not change.
- **`title`**: is the display title of the component.
- **`description`**: is a short sentence describing the purpose of the
  component. It should be written in imperative tense.
- **`spec`** contains the parameters required to configure the component and
  that are independent from its tasks. E.g., the API token of a vendor. In
  general, only AI, data or application components need such parameters.
- **`availableTasks`** defines the tasks the component can perform.
  - When a component is created in a pipeline, one of the tasks has to be
    selected, i.e., a configured component can only execute one task.
  - Task configurations are defined in `tasks.json`.
- **`documentationUrl`** points to the official documentation of the component.
- **`icon`** is the local path to the icon that will be displayed in the console
  when creating the component. If left blank, a placeholder icon will be shown.
- **`version`** must be a [SemVer](https://semver.org/) string. It is encouraged
  to keep a [tidy version history](#sane-version-control).
- **`sourceUrl`** points to the codebase that implements the component. This
  will be used by the documentation generation tool and also will be part of the
  [component definition
  list](https://openapi.instill.tech/reference/pipelinepublicservice_listcomponentdefinitions)
  endpoint.
- **`releaseStage`** describes the release stage of the component. Unimplemented
  stages (`RELEASE_STAGE_COMING_SOON` or `RELEASE_STAGE_OPEN_FOR_CONTRIBUTION`)
  will hide the component from the console (i.e. they can't be used in
  pipelines) but they will appear in the component definition list endpoint.
- **`public`** indicates whether the component is visible to the public.


#### `tasks.json`

The `tasks.json` file describes the task details of the component. The key
should be in the format `TASK_NAME`.

```json
{
  "TASK_GREET": {
    "instillShortDescription": "Greet someone / something",
    "title": "Greet",
    "input": {
      "description": "Input",
      "instillUIOrder": 0,
      "properties": {
        "target": {
          "instillUIOrder": 0,
          "description": "The target of the greeting",
          "instillAcceptFormats": [
            "string"
          ],
          "instillUpstreamTypes": [
            "value",
            "reference",
            "template"
          ],
          "instillUIMultiline": true,
          "title": "Greeting target",
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "target"
      ],
      "title": "Input",
      "type": "object"
    },
    "output": {
      "description": "The greeting sentence",
      "instillUIOrder": 0,
      "properties": {
        "greeting": {
          "description": "A greeting sentence addressed to the target",
          "instillUIOrder": 0,
          "required": [],
          "title": "Greeting",
          "type": "string",
          "instillFormat": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "greeting"
      ],
      "title": "Output",
      "type": "object"
    }
  }
}
```

This file defines the input and output schema of each task:

**Properties within a Task**

- **`title`** is used by the console to provide the title of the task in the
  component.
- **`description`** and **`instillShortDescription`** are used by the console to
  provide a description of the task in the component. If
  **`instillShortDescription`** does not exist, it will be the same as
  **`description`**.
- **`input`** is a JSON Schema that describes the input of the task.
- **`output`** is a JSON Schema that describes the output of the task.

**Properties within `input` and `output` Objects**

- **`required`** indicates whether the property is required.
- **`type`**: describes the JSON type of this field, which could be `integer`,
  `number`, `boolean`, `string`, `array`, or `object`.
- **`title`** is used by the console to provide the title of the property in the component.
- **`description`** is used by the console to provide information about this
  task in the component.
- **`instillShortDescription`**: is a concise version of `description`, used to
  fit smaller spaces such as a component form field. If this value is empty, the
  `description` value will be used.
- **`instillUIOrder`** defines the order in which the properties will be
  rendered in the component.
- **`instillUIMultiline`** indicates whether the text field in the component is
  multiline.

**Properties within `input` Objects**

- **`instillEditOnNodeFields`** determines whether this field will appear at the
  forefront of the component. Optional properties can be set in the
  advanced configuration.
- **`instillAcceptFormats`** is an array indicating the data types of acceptable
  input fields. It should be an array of [**Instill
  Format**](https://www.instill.tech/docs/vdp/instill-format).
  - Currently, we do not support the `time` type. When the input is a `date` or `datetime`, it should be represented as a string. The `date` or `datetime` will be automatically parsed in UTC timezone by the YAML parser. Please ensure this point is noted in the documentation, specifically for the `start-to-read-date` in the Slack component.
- **`instillUpstreamTypes`** defines how an input property can be set: as a
  direct value, a reference to another value in the pipeline, or a combination
  of both (e.g., `${variable.name}` or `my dear ${variable.name}`).
- **`instillSecret`** indicates the data must reference the secrets and cannot
  be used in plaintext.

**Properties within `output` Objects**

- **`instillFormat`** indicates the data type of the output field, which should
  be one of `number`, `integer`, `string`, `object`, `boolean`, or MIME type.
  Please refer to [**Instill
  Format**](https://www.instill.tech/docs/vdp/instill-format) for more details.

See the [example recipe](#example-recipe) to understand how these fields map to
the recipe of a pipeline when configured to use this operator.

#### `setup.json`

For components that need to set up some configuration before execution
(typically, components that connect with 3rd party applications or services that
need to set up a connection), `setup.json` can be used to describe these
configurations. The format is the same as the `input` objects in `tasks.json`.

The setup of a component can be defined within the recipe as key-value fields,
or as a reference to a **Connection** (see the
[**Integrations**](https://www.instill.tech/docs/vdp/integration) doc for more
information). Certain components support OAuth 2.0 integrations. If you want
your component to support this sort of connection:

- In `setup.json`, add the OAuth information under the  `instillOAuthConfig`
  property.
  - `authUrl` contains the address where the authorization code can be
    requested.
    - `accessUrl` contains the address where the authorization code can be
      exchanged for an access token.
    - `scopes` contains the permissions that will be associated with the access
      token. Refer to the vendor you want to integrate with in order to identify
      the scopes that will be required by the different tasks implemented by the
      component. Note that, if the component is extended later requiring more
      scopes, users will need to create a new connection in order to leverage
      the new functionality.
- The OAuth 2.0 exchange for an access token is implemented in the frontend.
  Make sure to engage with [Instill
  Product](https://github.com/orgs/instill-ai/teams/product) in order to
  prioritise the OAuth support for this component.

### Implement the component interfaces

Pipeline communicates with components through the `IComponent` interface,
defined in the [`base`](../base) package. This package also defines base
implementations for these interfaces, so the `hello` component will only need to
override the following methods:
- `CreateExecution(ComponentExecution)
  (IExecution, error)` will return an implementation of the `IExecution`
  interface. A base execution implementation is passed in order to define only
  the behaviour of the `Execute` method.
- `Execute(context.Context []*structpb.Struct) ([]*structpb.Struct, error)` is
  the most important function in the component. All the data manipulation will
  take place here.

Paste the following code into a `main.go` file in `operator/hello/v0`:

```go
package hello

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"

    _ "embed"

    "google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/structpb"

    "github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/pkg/component/base"
)

const (
  taskGreet = "TASK_GREET"
)

var (
  //go:embed config/definition.json
  definitionJSON []byte
  //go:embed config/tasks.json
  tasksJSON []byte

  once   sync.Once
  comp   *component
)

type component struct {
  base.Component
}

// Init returns an implementation of IComponent that implements the greeting
// task.
func Init(bc base.Component) *component {
  once.Do(func() {
    comp = &component{Component: bc}
    err := comp.LoadDefinition(definitionJSON, nil, tasksJSON, nil)
    if err != nil {
      panic(err)
    }
  })
  return comp
}

type execution struct {
    base.ComponentExecution
}

func (c *component) CreateExecution(x base.ComponentExecution) (base.IExecution, error) {
  e := &execution{ ComponentExecution: x }

  if x.Task != taskGreet {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("unsupported task")
  }

  return e, nil
}

func (e *execution) Execute(ctx context.Context, jobs []*base.Job) error {
  return nil
}
```

### Add the execution logic

The `hello` operator created in the previous section doesn't implement any
logic. This section will add the greeting logic to the `Execute` method.

Let's modify the following methods:

```go
type execution struct {
  base.ComponentExecution
  execute func(*structpb.Struct) (*structpb.Struct, error)
}

func (c *component) CreateExecution(x base.ComponentExecution) (base.IExecution, error) {
  e := &execution{ ComponentExecution: x }

  // A simple if statement would be enough in a component with a single task.
  // If the number of task grows, here is where the execution task would be
  // selected.
  switch x.Task {
  case taskGreet:
    e.execute = e.greet
  default:
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("unsupported task")
  }

  return e, nil
}

func (e *execution) Execute(ctx context.Context, jobs []*base.Job) error {
  // An execution  might take several inputs. One result will be returned for
  // each one of them, containing the execution output for that set of
  // parameters.
  for _, job := range jobs {
    input, err := job.Input.Read(ctx)
    if err != nil {
      return err
    }
  output, err := e.execute(input)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  err = job.Output.Write(ctx, output)
    if err != nil {
      return err
    }
  }

  return nil
}

func (e *execution) greet(in *structpb.Struct) (*structpb.Struct, error) {
  out := new(structpb.Struct)

  target := in.Fields["target"].GetStringValue()
  greeting := "Hello, " + target + "!"

  out.Fields = map[string]*structpb.Value{
    "greeting": structpb.NewStringValue(greeting),
  }

  return out, nil
}
```

#### End-user error messages

The [`errmsg`](https://github.com/instill-ai/x/tree/main/errmsg) package allows
us to attach messages to our errors.

```go
func (e *execution) greet(in *structpb.Struct) (*structpb.Struct, error) {
  out := new(structpb.Struct)

  greetee := in.Fields["target"].GetStringValue()
  if greetee == "Voldemort" {
    return nil, errmsg.AddMessage(fmt.Errorf("invalid greetee"), "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can't be greeted.")
  }

  greeting := "Hello, " + greetee + "!"

  out.Fields = map[string]*structpb.Value{
    "greeting": structpb.NewStringValue(greeting),
  }

  return out, nil
}
```

The middleware in `pipeline-backend` will capture error messages in order to
to return a human-friendly errors to the API clients and console users.

#### Unit tests

Before initializing testing your component in **💧 Instill VDP**, we can unit
test its behaviour. The following code covers the newly added logic by
replicating how the `pipeline-backend` workers execute the component logic.
Create a `main_test.go` file containing the following code:

```go
package hello

import (
  "context"
  "testing"

  "go.uber.org/zap"
  "google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/structpb"

  qt "github.com/frankban/quicktest"

  "github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/pkg/component/base"
  "github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/pkg/component/internal/mock"
  "github.com/instill-ai/x/errmsg"
)

func TestOperator_Execute(t *testing.T) {
  c := qt.New(t)
  ctx := context.Background()

  bc := base.Component{Logger: zap.NewNop()}
  component := Init(bc)

  c.Run("ok - greet", func(c *qt.C) {
    exec, err := component.CreateExecution(base.ComponentExecution{
      Component: component,
      Task:      taskGreet,
    })
    c.Assert(err, qt.IsNil)

    pbIn, err := structpb.NewStruct(map[string]any{"target": "bolero-wombat"})
    c.Assert(err, qt.IsNil)

    ir, ow, eh, job := mock.GenerateMockJob(c)
    ir.ReadMock.Return(&pbIn, nil)
    ow.WriteMock.Optional().Set(func(ctx context.Context, output *structpb.Struct) (err error) {
      // Check JSON in the output string.
      greeting := output.Fields["greeting"].GetStringValue()
      // When we use minimock, we can't use the `c.Assert` function.
      // Instead, we use the `mock.Equal` function built in the mock package.
      mock.Equal(greeting, "Hello, bolero-wombat!")
      return nil
    })
    eh.ErrorMock.Optional()

    err = execution.Execute(ctx, []*base.Job{job})
    c.Assert(err, qt.IsNil)
  })

  c.Run("nok - invalid greetee", func(c *qt.C) {
    x, err := comp.CreateExecution(base.ComponentExecution{
      Component: comp,
      Task:      taskGreet,
    })
    c.Assert(err, qt.IsNil)

    pbIn, err := structpb.NewStruct(map[string]any{"target": "Voldemort"})
    c.Assert(err, qt.IsNil)

    ir, ow, eh, job := mock.GenerateMockJob(c)
    ir.ReadMock.Return(pbIn, nil)
    ow.WriteMock.Optional().Set(func(ctx context.Context, output *structpb.Struct) (err error) {
      // Check JSON in the output string.
      greeting := output.Fields["greeting"].GetStringValue()
      mock.Equal(greeting, "Hello, Voldemort!")
      return nil
    })
    eh.ErrorMock.Optional()

    err = x.Execute(ctx, []*base.Job{job})
    c.Assert(err, qt.ErrorMatches, "invalid greetee")
    c.Assert(errmsg.Message(err), qt.Matches, "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can't be greeted.")
  })
}

func TestOperator_CreateExecution(t *testing.T) {
  c := qt.New(t)

  bc := base.Component{Logger: zap.NewNop()}
  operator := Init(bc)

  c.Run("nok - unsupported task", func(c *qt.C) {
    task := "FOOBAR"

    _, err := operator.CreateExecution(base.ComponentExecution{
      Component: component,
      Task: task,
    })
    c.Check(err, qt.ErrorMatches, "unsupported task")
  })
}
```


In our testing methodology, we use two main approaches for mocking external services:

1. In some components, we mock only the interface and skip testing the actual client, as with services like Slack and HubSpot.
2. In other components, we create a fake server for test purposes, as with OpenAI integrations.

Moving forward, we plan to standardize on the second approach, integrating all components to use a fake server setup for testing.


### Initialize the component

The last step before being able to use the component in **💧 Instill VDP** is
loading the `hello` operator. This is done in the `Init` function in
[`store.go`](./store/store.go):

```go
package store

import (
  // ...
  "github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/pkg/component/operator/hello/v0"
)

// ...

func Init(logger *zap.Logger) *Store {
  baseComp := base.component{Logger: logger}

  once.Do(func() {
    compStore = &Store{
      componentUIDMap: map[uuid.UUID]*component{},
      componentIDMap:  map[string]*component{},
    }
    // ...
    compStore.Import(hello.Init(baseComp))
  })

  return compStore
}
```

### Use the component in 💧 Instill VDP

Re-run your local `pipeline-backend` build:

```sh
$ make rm && make dev
$ docker exec pipeline-backend go run ./cmd/init # this will load the new component into the database
$ docker exec -d pipeline-backend go run ./cmd/worker # run without -d in a separate terminal if you want to access the logs
$ docker exec pipeline-backend go run ./cmd/main
```

Head to the console at http://localhost:3000/ (default password is `password`)
and create a pipeline.

- In the **variable** component, add a `who` text field.
- Create a **hello** operator and reference the **variable** input field by
  adding `${variable.who}` to the `target` field.
- In the **output** component, add a `greeting` output value that references the
  **hello** output by introducing `${hello-0.output.greeting}`.

You can copy the recipe from the [example](#example-recipe).

If you introduce a `Wombat` string value in the **Input** form and **Run** the
pipeline, you should see `Hello, Wombat!` in the response.

#### Example recipe

```yaml
variable:
  who:
    title: Who
    description: Who should be greeted?
    instill-format: string
component:
  hello-0:
    type: hello
    task: TASK_GREET
    input:
      target: ${variable.who}
output:
  greeting:
    title: Greeting
    description: The output greeting
    value: ${hello-0.output.greeting}
```

### Document the component

Documentation helps user to integrate the component in their pipelines. A good
component definition will have clear names for their fields, which will also
contain useful descriptions. The information described in `definition.json` and
`tasks.json` is enough to understand how a component should be used. `compogen`
is a tool that parses the component configuration and builds a `README.mdx` file
document displaying its information in a human-readable way. To generate the
document, just add the following line on top of `operator/hello/v0/main.go`:

```go
//go:generate compogen readme ./config ./README.mdx
```

Then, go to the base of the `pipeline-backend` repository and run:

```sh
$ make gen-component-doc
```

#### Adding extra sections

The documentation of the component can be extended with the `--extraContents`
flag:

```sh
$ mkdir -p operator/hello/.compogen
$ echo '### Final words

Thank you for reading!' > operator/hello/.compogen/extra-bottom.mdx
```

```go
//go:generate compogen readme ./config ./README.mdx --extraContents bottom=.compogen/extra-bottom.mdx
```

Check `compogen`'s [README](./tools/compogen/README.md) for more information.

## Sane version control

The version of a component is useful to track its evolution and to set
expectations about its stability. When the interface of a component (defined by
its configuration files) changes, its version should change following the
Semantic Versioning guidelines.

- Patch versions are intended for bug fixes.
- Minor versions are intended for backwards-compatible changes, e.g., a new task
  or a new input field with a default value.
- Major versions are intended for backwards-incompatible changes.
  - At this point, since there might be pipelines using the previous version, a
    new package MUST be created. E.g., `operator/json/v0` -> `operator/json/v1`.
- Build and pre-release labels are discouraged, as components are shipped as
  part of **💧 Instill VDP** and they aren't likely to need such fine-grained
  version control.

It is recommended to start a component at `v0.1.0`. A major version 0 is
intended for rapid development.

The `releaseStage` property in `definition.json` indicates the stability of a
component.

- A component skeleton (with only the minimal configuration files and a dummy
  implementation of the interfaces) may use the _Coming Soon_ or _Open For
  Contribution_ stages in order to communicate publicly about upcoming
  components. The major and minor versions in this case MUST be 0.
- Alpha pre-releases are used in initial implementations, intended to gather
  feedback and issues from early adopters.  Breaking changes are acceptable at
  this stage.
- Beta pre-releases are intended for stable components that don't expect
  breaking changes.
- General availability indicates production readiness. A broad adoption of the
  beta version in production indicates the transition to GA is ready.

The typical version and release stage evolution of a component might look like
this:

| Version | Release Stage         |
| :------ | :-------------------- |
| 0.1.0   | `RELEASE_STAGE_ALPHA` |
| 0.1.1   | `RELEASE_STAGE_ALPHA` |
| 0.1.2   | `RELEASE_STAGE_ALPHA` |
| 0.2.0   | `RELEASE_STAGE_ALPHA` |
| 0.2.1   | `RELEASE_STAGE_ALPHA` |
| 0.3.0   | `RELEASE_STAGE_BETA`  |
| 0.3.1   | `RELEASE_STAGE_BETA`  |
| 0.4.0   | `RELEASE_STAGE_BETA`  |
| 1.0.0   | `RELEASE_STAGE_GA`    |
