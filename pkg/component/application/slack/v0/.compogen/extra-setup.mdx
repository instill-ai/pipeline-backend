### Connecting through a Slack App

The Slack component connects with your workspace via a [Slack
App](https://api.slack.com/docs/apps). In order to read / write messages from / to Slack, you'll need to:

- [Add the
  app](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/202035138-Add-apps-to-your-Slack-workspace)
  to your workspace.
- Add the app to the channels you want to interact with.

The Slack integration on **Instill Cloud** uses OAuth 2.0 to connect with Slack
via the `instill-ai` app. There, [creating a
connection](https://www.instill.tech/docs/vdp/integration#creating-a-connection)
will simply require authenticating on Slack. Your newly created connection,
which you can reference in your pipelines, will allow you to read messages and
send them on behalf of your user or the `instill-ai` bot on the channels where
that app is installed.

If you want to connect with Slack via OAuth 2.0 on **Instill Core**, you will
need to provide your app's **client ID** and **client secret** [as environment
variables on Instill
Core](https://github.com/instill-ai/instill-core/blob/main/.env.component).
