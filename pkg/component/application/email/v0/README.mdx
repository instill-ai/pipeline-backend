The Email component is an application component that allows users to get and send email from Mail Protocol.
It can carry out the following tasks:
- [Send Email](#send-email)
- [Read Emails](#read-emails)

You can connect to different email servers through the Email component.
Emails are fetched and sent using the IMAP and SMTP protocols, respectively. You can set the server address and port for each protocol in the component configuration.


## Release Stage

`Alpha`



## Configuration

The component definition and tasks are defined in the [definition.json](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/blob/main/pkg/component/application/email/v0/config/definition.json) and [tasks.json](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/blob/main/pkg/component/application/email/v0/config/tasks.json) files respectively.




## Setup


In order to communicate with the
external application, the following connection details need to be
provided. You may specify them directly in a pipeline recipe as key-value pairs
within the component's `setup` block, or you can create a **Connection** from
the [**Integration Settings**](https://www.instill.tech/docs/vdp/integration)
page and reference the whole `setup` as `setup:
${connection.<my-connection-id>}`.
