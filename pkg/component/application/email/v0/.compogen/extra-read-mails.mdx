#### Mailbox

You have to confirm what exactly the mailbox name is.
Take Gmail as an example, the mailbox names are following.

| Mailbox | Mailbox Name to input |
| :--- | :--- |
| Inbox | `INBOX` |
| Sent | `[Gmail]/Sent Mail` |
| Drafts | `[Gmail]/Drafts` |


#### Search From and Search To
You need to input the exact same email address with `<` as a prefix and `>` as a suffix as the email you want to search for.
For example, if you want to search for the email from `email@example.com`, you need to input `<email@example.com>`.
