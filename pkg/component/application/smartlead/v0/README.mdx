The Smartlead component is an application component that allows users to organize your leads and helps you close more deals.
It can carry out the following tasks:
- [Create Campaign](#create-campaign)
- [Setup Campaign](#setup-campaign)
- [Save Sequences](#save-sequences)
- [Get Sequences](#get-sequences)
- [Add Leads](#add-leads)
- [Add Sender Email](#add-sender-email)
- [Update Campaign Status](#update-campaign-status)
- [Get Campaign Metric](#get-campaign-metric)
- [List Leads Status](#list-leads-status)

## Use Cases

To achieve the basic use case that creating a campaign from scratch, you need to follow the steps below:

1. Create campaign by `TASK_CREATE_CAMPAIGN`.
2. Update campaign schedule & update campaign general settings by `TASK_SETUP_CAMPAIGN`.
3. Save sequences by `TASK_SAVE_SEQUENCES`.
4. Add leads to the campaign by `TASK_ADD_LEADS`.
5. Add sender email by `TASK_ADD_SENDER_EMAIL`. Please notice that you need to create a sender email and configure in Smartlead console before adding it to the campaign.
6. Start campaign by `TASK_UPDATE_CAMPAIGN_STATUS`.

## Release Stage

`Alpha`



## Configuration

The component definition and tasks are defined in the [definition.yaml](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/blob/main/pkg/component/application/smartlead/v0/config/definition.yaml) and [tasks.yaml](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/blob/main/pkg/component/application/smartlead/v0/config/tasks.yaml) files respectively.




## Setup


In order to communicate with Smartlead, the following connection details need to be
provided. You may specify them directly in a pipeline recipe as key-value pairs
within the component's `setup` block, or you can create a **Connection** from
the [**Integration Settings**](https://docs.instill-ai.com/docs/set-up-component)
page and reference the whole `setup` as `setup:
${connection.<my-connection-id>}`.
