---

The GitHub component is an application component that allows users to do anything available on GitHub.
It can carry out the following tasks:
- [List Pull Requests](#list-pull-requests)
- [Get Pull Request](#get-pull-request)
- [Get Commit](#get-commit)
- [List Review Comments](#list-review-comments)
- [Create Review Comment](#create-review-comment)
- [List Issues](#list-issues)
- [Get Issue](#get-issue)
- [Create Issue](#create-issue)
- [Create Webhook](#create-webhook)

## Release Stage

`Alpha`

## Configuration

The component definition and tasks are defined in the [definition.json](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/pkg/component/blob/main/application/github/v0/config/definition.json) and [tasks.json](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/pkg/component/blob/main/application/github/v0/config/tasks.json) files respectively.

## Setup


In order to communicate with GitHub, the following connection details need to be
provided. You may specify them directly in a pipeline recipe as key-value pairs
within the component's `setup` block, or you can create a **Connection** from
the [**Integration Settings**](https://www.instill.tech/docs/vdp/integration)
page and reference the whole `setup` as `setup:
${connection.<my-connection-id>}`.
