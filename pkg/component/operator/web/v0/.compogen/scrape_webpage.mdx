#### Scraping Support for Dynamic Content
This function provides scraping support to fetch dynamic content from web pages while simulating user behaviors, such as scrolling down. The initial implementation includes the following capabilities:

Scrolling:
- Mimics user scrolling down the page to load additional content dynamically.

Future enhancements will include additional user interactions, such as:
- Clicking: Simulate mouse clicks on specified elements.
- Taking Screenshots: Capture screenshots of the current view.
- Keyboard Actions: Simulate key presses and other keyboard interactions.

This function aims to provide a robust framework for interacting with web pages and extracting dynamic content effectively.
