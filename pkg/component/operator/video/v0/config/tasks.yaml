TASK_SEGMENT:
  shortDescription: Split a video into multiple shorter clips based on user-defined time segments. This task takes a video input and an optional list of
    time ranges, then produces an array of video segments corresponding to those ranges. Each segment becomes a separate video clip, enabling precise extraction
    of specific portions from the original content for targeted use or analysis.
