By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population. 1 For a new technology, this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024).\nThis paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the largest. 2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities. 3\nThe sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported adoption of LLMs (Bick et al., 2024; Pew Research Center, 2025); however there are reasons to expect bias in self-reports (Ling and Imas, 2025), and none of these papers have been able to directly track the quantity or nature of chatbot conversations.\nTwo recent papers do report statistics on chatbot conversations, classified in a variety of ways (Handa et al., 2025; Tomlinson et al., 2025). We build on this work in several respects. First, the pool of users on ChatGPT is far larger, meaning we expect our data to be a closer approximation to the average chatbot user. 4 Second, we use automated classifiers to report on the types of messages that users send using new classification taxonomies relative to the existing literature. Third, we report the diffusion of chatbot use across populations and the growth of different types of usage within cohorts.

Third, we report the diffusion of chatbot use across populations and the growth of different types of usage within cohorts. Fourth, we use a secure data clean room protocol to analyze aggregated employment and education categories for a sample of our users, lending new insights about differences in the types of messages sent by different groups while protecting user privacy.\nOur primary sample is a random selection of messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro) between May 2024 and June 2025. 5 Messages from the user to chatbot are classified automatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work, the topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the O*NET task the user is performing. Each taxonomy is defined in a prompt passed to an LLM, allowing us to classify messages without any human seeing them. We give the text of most prompts in Appendix A along with details about how the prompts were validated in Appendix B. 6 The classification pipeline is protected by a series of privacy measures, detailed below, to ensure no leakage of sensitive information during the automated analysis. In a secure data clean room, we relate taxonomies of messages to aggregated employment and education categories.\nTable 1 shows the growth in total message volume for work and non-work usage. Both types of\n1 Reuters (2025), Roth (2025)\n2 Bick et al. (2024) report that 28% of US adults used ChatGPT in late 2024, higher than any other chatbot.\n3 We use the term LLM loosely here and give more details in the following section.\n4 Wiggers (2025) reports estimates that in April 2025 ChatGPT was receiving more than 10 times as many visitors as either Claude or Copilot.\n5 Our sample includes the three consumer plans (Free, Plus, or Pro). OpenAI also offers a variety of other ChatGPT plans (Business fka. Teams, Enterprise, Education), which we do not include in our sample.\n6 Our classifiers take into account not just the randomly-selected user message, but also a portion of the preceding messages in that conversation.\nTable 1: ChatGPT daily message counts (millions), broken down by likely work-related or non-work-related. Total daily counts are exact measurements of message volume from all consumer plans. Daily counts of work and non-work related messages are estimated by classifying a random sample of conversations from that day. Sampling is done to exclude users who opt-out of sharing their messages for model training, users who selfreport their age as under 18, logged-out users, deleted conversations, and accounts which have been deactivated or banned (details available in Section 3). Reported values are 7-day averages (to smooth weekly fluctuation) ending on the 26th of June 2024 and 26th of June 2025.\n| Month    | Non-Work (M)   | (%)   |   Work (M) | (%)   | Total Messages (M)   |\n|----------|----------------|-------|------------|-------|----------------------|\n| Jun 2024 | 238            | 53%   |        213 | 47%   | 451                  |\n| Jun 2025 | 1,911          | 73%   |        716 | 27%   | 2,627                |\n\n\nmessages have grown continuously, but non-work messages have grown faster and now represent more than 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages.

The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to changing usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT users.

This finding is consistent with Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025), who use choice experiments to uncover willingness-to-pay for generative AI and estimate a consumer surplus of at least $ 97 billion in 2024 alone in the US.\nWe next report on a classification of messages using a taxonomy developed at OpenAI for understanding product usage ('conversation classifier'). Nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage falls into three broad categories, which we call Practical Guidance , Seeking Information , and Writing . Practical Guidance is the most common use case and includes activities like tutoring and teaching, how-to advice about a variety of topics, and creative ideation. 7 Seeking Information includes searching for information about people, current events, products, and recipes, and appears to be a very close substitute for web search. Writing includes the automated production of emails, documents and other communications, but also editing, critiquing, summarizing, and translating text provided by the user. Writing is the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average in June 2025. About two-thirds of all Writing messages ask ChatGPT to modify user text (editing, critiquing, translating, etc.) rather\nat work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average in June 2025. About two-thirds of all Writing messages ask ChatGPT to modify user text (editing, critiquing, translating, etc.) rather than creating new text from scratch. About 10% of all messages are requests for tutoring or teaching, suggesting that education is a key use case for ChatGPT.\nTwo of our findings stand in contrast to other work. First, we find the share of messages related to computer coding is relatively small: only 4.2% of ChatGPT messages are related to computer programming, compared to 33% of work-related Claude conversations Handa et al. (2025). 8 Second, we find the share of messages related to companionship or social-emotional issues is fairly small: only 1.9% of ChatGPT messages are on the topic of Relationships and Personal Reflection and 0.4% are related\n7 The difference between Practical Guidance and Seeking Information is that the former is highly customized to the user and can be adapted based on conversation and follow-up, whereas the latter is factual information that should be the same for all users. For example, users interested in running might ask ChatGPT for the Boston Marathon qualifying times by age and gender ( Seeking Information ), or they might ask for a customized workout plan that matches their goals and current level of fitness ( Practical Guidance ).\n8 Handa et al. (2025) report that 37% of conversations are mapped to a 'computer and mathematical' occupation category, and their Figure 12 shows 30% or more of all imputed tasks are programming or IT-related. We believe the discrepancy is partly due to the difference in types of users between Claude and ChatGPT, additionally Handa et al. (2025) only includes queries that 'possibly involve an occupational task'.\nto Games and Role Play . In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates that Therapy/Companionship is the most prevalent use case for generative AI. 9\nWe also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First, we show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time, and may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active users had typically masculine first names. 10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025, with active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that nearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps have narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively faster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and users in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work.",

Fourth, we find that educated users and users in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work.\nWe introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is seeking, using a simple rubric that we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing. 11 Asking is when the user is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving models of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and Schneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)). Doing is when the user wants to produce some output or perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al. (2003)). Expressing is when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or action. We estimate that about 49% of messages are Asking , 40% are Doing , and 11% are Expressing. However, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified as Doing (e.g., performing job tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those are Writing tasks. The relative frequency of writingrelated conversations is notable for\nwork-related messages are classified as Doing (e.g., performing job tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those are Writing tasks. The relative frequency of writingrelated conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all white-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top 'soft' skills demanded by employers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of generative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs such as writing and software code.\nWe also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that about 58% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining, documenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems, and thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage are highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activities Getting Information and Making Decisions and Solving Problems are in the top five of message frequency in nearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales occupations.\nOverall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT use cases in most jobs. This is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is either Practical Guidance or Seeking Information . We also show that Asking is growing faster than\n9 Zao-Sanders (2025) is based on a manual collection and labeling of online resources (Reddit, Quora, online articles), and so we believe it likely resulted in an unrepresentative distribution of use cases.\n10 Among those with names commonly associated with a particular gender.\n11 Appendix A gives the full prompt text and Appendix B gives detail about how the prompts were validated against public conversation data.\nDoing , and that Asking messages are consistently rated as having higher quality both by a classifier that measures user satisfaction and from direct user feedback.\nHow does ChatGPT provide economic value, and for whom is its value the greatest? We argue that ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support , which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs where better decision-making increases productivity (Deming, 2021; Caplin et al., 2023). This explains why Asking is relatively more common for educated users who are employed in highly-paid, professional occupations. Our findings are most consistent with Ide and Talamas (2025), who develop a model where AI agents can serve either as co-workers that produce output or as co-pilots that give advice and improve the productivity of human problem-solving.",

      "Text": "## 2 What is ChatGPT?\n\nHere we give a simplified overview of LLMs and chatbots. For more precise details, refer to the papers and system cards that OpenAI has released with each model e.g., (OpenAI, 2023, 2024a, 2025b). A chatbot is a statistical model trained to generate a text response given some text input, so as to maximize the 'quality' of that response, where the quality is measured with a variety of metrics.\nIn a prototypical interaction, a user submits a plain-text message ('prompt') and ChatGPT returns the message ('response') generated from an underlying LLM. A large set of additional features have been added to ChatGPT-including the possibility for the LLM to search the web or external databases, and generate images based on text-but the exchange of text-based messages remains the most typical interaction.\nSince its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5. 12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model's weights and to the model's system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).\nAn LLM can be thought of as a function from a string of words to a probability distribution over the set of all possible words (more precisely, 'tokens,' which very roughly correspond to words 13 ). The functions are implemented with deep neural nets, typically with a transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), parameterized with billions of model 'weights'. We will refer to all of ChatGPT's models as language models, though most can additionally process tokens representing images, audio, or other media.\nThe weights in an LLM-based chatbot are often trained in two stages, commonly called 'pretraining' and 'post-training'. In the first stage ('pre-training'), the LLMs are trained to predict the next word in a string, given the preceding words, over an enormous corpus of text. At that point the models are purely predictors of the likelihood of the next word given a prior context, and as such they have a relatively narrow application. In the second stage ('post-training'), the models are trained to produce words that comprise 'good' responses to some prompt. This stage often consists of a variety of different strategies: fine-tuning on a dataset of queries and ideal responses, reinforcement learning against another model that is trained to grade the quality of a response (Ouyang et al., 2022), or reinforcement learning against a function that knows the true response to queries (OpenAI (2024b),\n12 For a timeline of model launches, see Appendix C.\n13 Tokenization is a way of cutting a string of text into discrete chunks, chosen to be statistically efficient. In many tokenization schemes, one token corresponds to roughly three-quarters of an English word.\nLambert et al. (2024)). This second stage also typically includes a number of 'safety' constraints to avoid certain classes of response, especially those which are deemed harmful or dangerous (OpenAI, 2025a).\nThis two-stage process has a common statistical interpretation: the first stage teaches the model a latent representation of the world; the second stage fits a function using that representation (Bengio et al., 2014). Pre-training the model to predict the next word effectively teaches the model a lowdimensional representation of text, representing only the key semantic features, and therefore rendering the prompt-response problem tractable with a reasonable set of training examples.\nTwo common ways of evaluating chatbots are with benchmarks (batteries of questions with known answers, e.g. Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (Hendrycks et al., 2021)) and comparisons of human preferences over two alternative responses to the same message (e.g. Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024)).",

No member of the research team ever saw the content of user messages, and all analyses were conducted in accordance with OpenAI's Privacy Policy (OpenAI, 2025c).\nThe analysis in this paper is based on the following datasets:\n- 1.

Employment: aggregated employment and education categories based on publicly available data for a subset of consumer ChatGPT users. This data is only used in Section 6.\nWe describe the contents of each dataset, the sampling procedures that produced them, and the privacy protections we implemented in constructing and employing them in analysis.\n## 3.1 Growth Dataset\nWe compiled a dataset covering all usage on consumer ChatGPT Plans (Free, Plus, Pro) since ChatGPT's launch in November 2022. We exclude users on non-consumer plans (Business f.k.a. Teams,\n14 The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and June 26, 2025.\n15 The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and July 31, 2025.\n## Enterprise, Education).\nFor each user and day, this dataset reports the total number of messages sent by the user on that day. It also reports, for each message, de-identified user metadata, including the timestamp of their first interaction with ChatGPT, the country from which their account is registered, their subscription plan on each day, and their self-reported age (reported in coarse 5-7-year buckets to protect user privacy).\n## 3.2 Classified Messages\nTo understand usage while preserving user privacy, we construct message-level datasets without any human ever reading the contents of a message. See Figure 1 for an overview of the privacy-preserving classification pipeline. Messages are categorized according to 5 different LLM-based classifiers. The classifiers are introduced in more detail in Section 5, their exact text is reproduced in Appendix A, and our validation procedure is described in Appendix B.\nSampled From All ChatGPT Users. We uniformly sampled approximately 1.1 million conversations, and then sampled one message within each conversation, with the following restrictions:\n- 1. We only include messages from May 2024 to July 2025.\n- 2. We exclude conversations from users who opted out of sharing their messages for model training.\n- 3. We exclude users who self-report their age as under 18.\n- 4. We exclude conversations that users have deleted and from users whose accounts have been deactivated or banned.\n- 5. We exclude logged-out users, 16 which represented a minority share of ChatGPT users over the sample period.\nOur sample is drawn from a table that is itself sampled, where the sampling rate varied over time.

We thus adjust our sampling weights to maintain a fixed ratio with aggregate messages sent.\nSampled From a Subset of ChatGPT Users. We construct two samples of classified messages from a subset of ChatGPT users (approximately 130,000 users). This sample of users does not include any users who opted out of sharing their messages for training, nor does it include users whose selfreported age is below 18, nor does it include users who have been banned or deleted their accounts.\nThe first sample contains classifications of 1.58 million messages from this subset of users, sampled at the conversation level (a conversation is a series of messages between the user and chatbot). This sample is constructed such that the user's representation in the data is proportional to overall message volume. The second sample contains messages sent from this subset of users, sampled at the user level with up to six messages from each user in the group.\n16 ChatGPT became available to logged-out users in April 2024, i.e., users could use ChatGPT without signing up for an account with an email address. However, messages from logged-out users are only available in our dataset from March 2025, thus for consistency we drop all messages from logged-out users.\nFigure 1: Illustration of Privacy-Preserving Automated Classification Pipeline (Synthetic Example). Messages are first stripped of PII via an internal LLM-based tool called Privacy Filter . Then they are classified by LLM-based automated classifiers, described in detail in Appendices A and B. Humans do not see raw messages or PII-scrubbed messages, only the final classifications of messages.\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e\nPrivacy via Automated Classifiers. No one looked at the content of messages while conducting analysis for this paper. All analysis of message content was performed via automated LLM-based classifiers run on de-identified and PII-scrubbed message data (see Figure 1). The messages are first scrubbed of PII using an internal LLM-based tool, 17 and then classified according to classifiers defined over a controlled label space-the most precise classifier we use on the message-level data set is the O*NET Intermediate Work Activities taxonomy, which we augment to end up with 333 categories. We introduce technical and procedural frictions that prevent accidental access to the underlying text (for example, interfaces that do not render message text to researchers).\nOur classifications aim to discern the intent of a given message, and thus we include the prior 10 messages in a conversation as context. 18 For an example, see Table 2.\nTable 2: Illustration of Context-Augmented Message Classifications (Synthetic Example). The left column shows a standalone message to be classified, and the right column shows the prior context included in the classification of the message on the left.\n| Stand-Alone Message   | Message with Prior Context                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [user]: '10 more'     | [user]: 'give me 3 cultural activities to do with teens' [assistant]: '1.

This sample included approximately 130,000 Free, Plus, and Pro users, and the employment categories were aggregated by a vendor working through a secure Data Clean Room (DCR). For this analysis, we use the same exclusion criteria as for the message-level datasets: we exclude deactivated users, banned users, users who have opted out of training, and users whose self-reported age is under 18. Because the data was only available for a subset of users the results may not be representative of the full pool of users.\nDescription. The employment data, which is aggregated from publicly available sources, includes industry, occupations coarsened to O*NET categories, seniority level, company size, and education information that is limited to the degree attained. A vendor working within a DCR procured this dataset, restricted us to running only aggregated queries against it through the DCR, and deleted it upon the study's completion.\nPrivacy via a Data Clean Room. We never directly accessed user-level demographic records. All analysis of employment data was executed exclusively within a secure DCR that permits only pre-approved aggregate computations across independently held datasets; neither party can view or export the other party's underlying records. We governed the DCR with strict protocols: To execute any query that touched the external demographic data, we first obtained explicit sign-off from a committee of 6 coauthors and then submitted the notebook to our data partner for approval; only approved notebooks could run in the DCR (see Figure 2).\nOur partner enforced strict aggregation limits: they only approved code that returned cells meeting a threshold of 100 users. Consequently, no individual rows or narrowly defined categories were ever visible to researchers. For example, if 99 users had the occupation 'anesthesiologist,' any occupationlevel output would place those users into a 'suppressed' category, or place these observations in a coarsened category (e.g. 'medical professionals') rather than reporting a separate cell of anesthesiologists.\n19 The dataset was collected from a third party chatbot using OpenAI's LLMs via their API.\nFigure 2: Illustration of Aggregated Employment Category Analysis via a Data Clean Room. All queries run in the Data Clean Room must be approved by our data partner, enforcing a strict aggregation threshold (100 observations). As a result, researchers cannot access user-level employment data, only aggregated employment categories.\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e\n## 3.4 Summarizing Our Approach to Privacy\nWe took measures to safeguard user privacy at every stage of analysis.

(2025), Eloundou et al. (2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)) that rely on automated classification rather than human inspection of raw transcripts. In particular, Phang et al. (2025)'s study of affective use of ChatGPT and Eloundou et al. (2025) investigation of first-person fairness in chatbots both analyze ChatGPT message content via automated classifiers and emphasize classifierbased labeling as a scalable, privacy-preserving approach. Anthropic's Handa et al. (2025) used a similar approach: their Clio methodology applies automated classifiers to large collections of conversations, classifying conversations into thousands of topics, and in their appendix they describe manual validation on sampled conversations (100 user conversations flagged for review and 100 randomly sampled calibrations). Like Eloundou et al., we validate our classifiers using WildChat, a public dataset of user conversations.\nOther papers have analyzed digital behavior and demographic data; we mention a few relevant precedents here. Humlum and Vestergaard (2025b) and Humlum and Vestergaard (2025a), for example, analyze large-scale surveys on chatbot use along with Danish administrative labor market data. Chetty et al. (2022) analyze de-identified Facebook friendship graphs and anonymized IRS tax records, aggregated at the zip code level.\n## 4 The Growth of ChatGPT\nChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022 as a 'research preview,' and by December 5 it had more than one million registered users. Figure 3 reports the growth of overall weekly active users (WAU) on consumer plans over time. ChatGPT had more than 100 million logged-in WAU after one year, and almost 350 million after two years. By the end of July 2025, ChatGPT had more than 700 million total WAU, nearly 10% of the world's adult population. 20\nFigure 3: Weekly active ChatGPT users on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), shown as point-in-time snapshots every six months, November 2022-September 2025.\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e\nFigure 4 presents growth in the total messages sent by users over time. The solid line shows that between July 2024 and July 2025, the number of messages sent grew by a factor of more than 5.\nFigure 4 also shows the contribution of individual cohorts of users to aggregate message volume. The yellow line represents the first cohort of ChatGPT users: their usage declined somewhat over 2023, but started growing again in late 2024 and is now higher than it has ever been. The pink line represents messages from users who signed up in Q3 of 2023 or earlier, and so the difference between\n20 Note that we expect our counts of distinct accounts to somewhat exceed distinct people when one person has two accounts (or, for logged-out users, one person using two devices).

For logged-out users, the count is based on distinct browser cookies; this would double-count people if someone returns to ChatGPT after clearing their cookies, or if they access ChatGPT with two different devices in the same week.\nFigure 4: Daily message volumes from ChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), split by sign-up date of the requesting user.

There has been dramatic growth in message volume both by new cohorts of users, and from growth in existing cohorts.\nFigure 5 normalizes each cohort, plotting daily messages per weekly active user. Each line represents an individual cohort (instead of a cumulative cohort, as in Figure 4). The figure shows that earlier sign-ups have consistently had higher usage, but that usage has also consistently grown within every cohort, which we interpret as due to both (1) improvements in the capabilities of the models, and (2) users slowly discovering new uses for existing capabilities.\n## 5 How ChatGPT is Used\nWe next report on the content of ChatGPT conversations using a variety of different taxonomies. For each taxonomy we describe a 'prompt' which defines a set of categories, and then apply an LLM to map each message to a category. Our categories often apply to the user's intention , rather than the text of the conversation, and as such we never directly observe the ground truth. Nevertheless the classifier results can be interpreted as the best-guess inferences that a human would make: the guesses from the LLM correlate highly with human guesses from the same prompt, and we get similar qualitative results when the prompt includes a third category for 'uncertain.'\nFigure 5: Daily messages sent per weekly active user, split by sign-up cohort. Sample only considers users of ChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro). Reported values are moving averages of the past 90 days and are reported starting 90 days after the cohort is fully formed.

The critical part of the prompt is as follows: 21\nDoes the last user message of this conversation transcript seem likely to be related to doing some work/employment? Answer with one of the following:\n- (1) likely part of work (e.g., 'rewrite this HR complaint')\n- (0) likely not part of work (e.g., 'does ice reduce pimples?')\nTable 1 shows that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, however non-work-related messages grew faster: 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which climbed to 73% by June 2025.\nFigure 6 plots the share of non-work messages decomposed by cumulative sign-up cohorts. Successive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work use has increased. Comparing the share among all users (black line) to the share among the earliest cohort of users (yellow line), we can see that they track very closely.\n21 See Appendix A for the full prompt, see Appendix B for validation.\nFigure 6: The solid black line represents the probability that a messages on a given day is not related to work, as determined by an automated classifier. Values are averaged over a 28-day lagging window. The dotted orange line shows the same calculation, but conditioned on messages being from users who first used ChatGPT during or before Q2 of 2024. The remaining lines are defined similarly for successive quarters, with coloring cooling for more recent cohorts. Counts are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations from May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025.

The classifier itself directly assigns the user's query into one of 24 categories. We aggregate these 24 categories into seven topical groupings (the full conversationcategorization prompt is given in Appendix A):\n| Topic              | Conversation Category                                                                                                     |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Writing            | Edit or Critique Provided Text Personal Writing or Communication Translation Argument or Summary Generation Write Fiction |\n| Practical Guidance | How-To Advice Tutoring or Teaching Creative Ideation Health, Fitness, Beauty, or Self-Care                                |\n| Technical Help     | Mathematical Calculation Data Analysis                                                                                    |\n\n| Topic               | Conversation Category                                                            |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Multimedia          | Create an Image Analyze an Image Generate or Retrieve Other Media                |\n| Seeking Information | Specific Info Purchasable Products Cooking and Recipes                           |\n| Self-Expression     | Greetings and Chitchat Relationships and Personal Reflection Games and Role Play |\n| Other/Unknown       | Asking About the Model Other Unclear                                             |\n\n\nFigure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time. The three most common Conversation Topics are Practical Guidance , Seeking Information , and Writing , collectively accounting for about 77% of all ChatGPT conversations. Practical Guidance has remained constant at roughly 29% of overall usage. Writing has declined from 36% of all usage in July 2024 to 24% a year later. Seeking Information has grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share of Technical Help declined from 12% from all usage in July 2024 to around 5% a year later - this may be because the use of LLMs for programming has grown very rapidly through the API (outside of ChatGPT), for AI assistance in code editing and for autonomous programming agents (e.g. Codex). Multimedia grew from 2% to just over 7%, with a large spike in April 2025 after ChatGPT released new imagegeneration capabilities: the spike attenuated but the elevated level has persisted.\nFigure 8 shows Conversation Topics, restricting the sample to only work-related messages. About 40% of all work-related messages in July 2025 are Writing , by far the most common Conversation Topic. Practical Guidance is the second most common use case at 24%. Technical Help has declined from 18% of all work-related messages in July 2024 to just over 10% in July 2025.\nFigure 9 disaggregates four of the seven Conversation Topics into smaller groups and sums up messages of each type over a one-year period. For example, the five sub-categories within Writing are (in order of frequency) Editing or Critiquing Provided Text , Personal Writing or Communication , Translation , Argument or Summary Generation , and Writing Fiction . Three of those five categories ( Editing or Critiquing Provided Text , Translation , and Argument or Summary Generation ) are requests to modify text that has been provided to ChatGPT by the user, whereas the other two are requests to produce novel text. The former constitute two thirds of all Writing conversations, which\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e\nFigure 7: Share of consumer ChatGPT messages broken down by high level conversation topic, according to the mapping in Table 3.

Education is a major use case for ChatGPT. 10.2% of all user messages and 36% of Practical Guidance messages are requests for Tutoring or Teaching . Another large share - 8.5% in total and 30% of Practical Guidance - is general how-to advice on a variety of topics. Technical Help includes Computer Programming (4.2% of messages), Mathematical Calculations (3%), and Data Analysis (0.4%). Looking at the topic of Self-Expression , only 2.4% of all ChatGPT messages are about Relationships and Personal Reflection (1.9%) or Games and Role Play (0.4%).\nWhile users can seek information and advice from traditional web search engines as well as from ChatGPT, the ability to produce writing, software code, spreadsheets, and other digital products distinguishes generative AI from existing technologies. ChatGPT is also more flexible than web search even for traditional applications like Seeking Information and Practical Guidance , because users receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy football team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided content and follow-up requests.\nFigure 9: Breakdown of granular conversation topic shares within the coarse mapping defined in Table 3.

In order to learn more about how people seek to use generative AI at work and outside of work, we introduce a classifier that is designed to measure the type of output the user hopes to receive. Specifically, we classify messages according to user intent, coding up conversations according to a simple Asking, Doing, or Expressing rubric. The critical part of our classification prompt is as follows:\n| Intent     | Prompt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Asking     | Asking is seeking information or advice that will help the user be better informed or make better decisions, either at work, at school, or in their personal life.

The figure also shows the relationship with our Topic classification: the two taxonomies are correlated but not redundant: Asking queries are more likely to be Practical Guidance and Seeking Information . Doing queries are disproportionately Writing and Multimedia . Expressing queries are disproportionately Self-Expression . However, the overlap is imperfect. For example, within the Practical Guidance topic, an Asking message might be advice about how to recover from a sports injury given a user's personal history, while a Doing message might request ChatGPT to produce a customized recovery and training plan that could be printed or saved. Within Technical Help , an Asking message might request help understanding how to debug some code, while a Doing message might ask ChatGPT to write code for the user directly.\nFigure 11 presents shares of Asking/Doing/Expressing just for work-related messages. Doing constitutes nearly 56% of work-related queries, compared to 35% for Asking and 9% for Expressing . Nearly 35% of all work-related queries are Doing messages related to Writing . Doing and Asking comprise equal shares of Technical Help queries.\nFigure 10: Breakdown of Conversation Topics by Asking/Doing/Expressing category, with topic columns sorted by relative share of 'Doing' messages.

O*NET was developed in partnership with the U.S. Department of Labor and systematically classifies jobs according to the skills, tasks, and work activities required to perform them. O*NET associates each occupation with a set of tasks that are performed at different levels of intensity. Each task is then aggregated up to three levels of detail - 2,087 detailed work activities (DWAs), 332 intermediate work activities (IWAs), and 41 generalized work activities (GWAs).\nTo understand the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage, we mapped messages to one of the 332 O*NET Intermediate Work Activities (IWA), with an additional option of Ambiguous to account for situations where the user message lacked sufficient context. 22 We then used the official\n22 We drew a sample of approximately 1.1 million conversations from May 2024 to June 2025, selected a random message within each, and classified it according to the prompt in A.\nFigure 13: Shares of Asking, Doing, and Expressing messages split by work vs. non-work.

Our Interaction Quality classifier looks for an expression of satisfaction or dissatisfaction in the user's subsequent message in the same conversation (if one exists), with three possible categories: Good , Bad , and Unknown . 23\nFigure 16 plots the overall growth of messages in these three buckets. In late 2024 Good interactions were about three times as common as Bad interactions, but Good interactions grew much more rapidly over the next nine months, and by July 2025 they were more than four times more common.\nFigure 16: Interaction quality shares, based on automated sentiment analysis of the next response provided by the user.

Sampling details available in Section 3.\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e\n## 6 Who Uses ChatGPT\nIn this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work documents variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in the U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark (Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently by men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.\nWe make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demographic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for selected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have changed over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by education and occupation.\n## 6.1 Name Analysis\nWe investigate potential variation by gender by classifying a global random sample of over 1.1 million ChatGPT users' first names using public aggregated datasets of name-gender associations. We used the World Gender Name Dictionary, and Social Security popular names, as well as datasets of popular Brazilian and Latin American names. This methodology is similar to that in (Hofstra et al., 2020) and (West et al., 2013). Names that were not in these datasets, or were flagged as ambiguous in the datasets, or had significant disagreement amongst these datasets were classified as Unknown .\nExcluding Unknown , a significant share (around 80%) of the weekly active users (WAU) in the first few months after ChatGPT was released were by users with typically masculine first names. However, in the first half of 2025, we see the share of active users with typically feminine and typically masculine names reach near-parity. By June 2025 we observe active users are more likely to have typically feminine names. This suggests that gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have closed substantially over time.\nWe also study differences in usage topics. Users with typically female first names are relatively more likely to send messages related to Writing and Practical Guidance . By contrast, users with typically male first names are more likely to use ChatGPT for Technical Help , Seeking Out Information , and Multimedia (e.g., modifying or creating images).\n## 6.2 Variation by Age\nA subset of users self-report their age when registering for OpenAI. Among those who self-report their age, around 46% of the messages in our dataset are accounted for by users 18-25.\nA higher share of messages are work-related for older users. Work-related messages comprised approximately 23% of messages for users under age 26, with this share increasing with age. The one exception is users who self-attest to being 66 years-old or older, with only 16% of their classified messages being work-related. The plot below shows trends in the share of work-related messages by age group. ChatGPT usage has become less work-related over time for users of all ages.",

Observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given day.\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e\n## 6.3 Variation by Country\nWe study global patterns of ChatGPT usage by measuring the proportion of weekly consumer ChatGPT users among the internet enabled population of countries with populations larger than 1 million. We also exclude countries in which ChatGPT is blocked. The figure below plots this proportion in May 2024 and May 2025 by GDP-per-capita deciles: countries are ranked by GDP-per-capita and split into ten deciles, and the x-axis shows each decile's median GDP-per-capita (in thousands of U.S. dollars). 24 The solid line shows the median share within each decile; the shaded band is the interquartile range (25th-75th percentile) of country values within that decile. Comparing May 2024 to May 2025, we see that the adoption of ChatGPT grew dramatically, but also that there was disproportionate growth in low to middle-income countries ( $ 10,000-40,000 GDP-per-capita). Overall, we find that many low-to-middle income countries have experienced high growth in ChatGPT adoption.\n## 6.4 Variation by Education\nWe next analyze results from matching with publicly available datasets.\nFigure 22 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user education. Panel A shows the share of messages that are work-related, for users with less than a bachelor's degree, exactly a bachelor's degree, and some graduate education respectively. 25 The left-hand side of figure 22 shows unadjusted comparisons, while the right-hand side presents the coefficient on education from a regression of\n24 GDP and population data are from the World Bank 2023 estimates.\n25 For non-US users, we consider tertiary education to be the equivalent of a bachelor's degree.\nFigure 21: ChatGPT Weekly Active Users as Share of Internet Population vs GDP decile, May 2024 vs May 2025.

Those differences are cut roughly in half after adjusting for other characteristics, but they are still statistically significant at the less than 1 percent level. Educated users are more likely to send work-related messages.\nPanel B explores variation by education in user intent. Asking constitutes about 49% of messages for users with less than a bachelor's degree, with little variation for more educated users. After regression adjustment, we find that users with a graduate degree are about two percentage points more likely to use ChatGPT for Asking messages, a difference that is statistically significant at the 5% level. Prior to regression adjustment, the frequency of Doing messages is increasing in education. However, this pattern reverses after adjusting for other characteristics such as occupation. Users with a graduate degree are about 1.6 percentage points less likely to send Doing messages than users with less than a bachelor's degree, and the difference is statistically significant at the 10% level.\nPanel C studies variation by education in the frequency of four different conversation topics Practical Guidance , Seeking Information , Technical Help , and Writing .

(To guarantee user privacy, we coarsen all covariates to broad categories and programmatically enforce that each group has at least 100 members prior to running the regression) We add the coefficients on each education and occupation category to the unadjusted value for the reference category and compute 95% confidence intervals using the standard errors from the regression coefficients.

Due to privacy-preserving aggregation limits, we report results for the following broad occupation categories - (1) all nonprofessional occupations, including administrative, clerical, service, and blue-collar occupations; (2) computerrelated occupations; (3) engineering and science occupations; (4) management and business occupations; and (5) all other professional occupations, including law, education, and health care. 26 As above, the left-hand side of the figure shows unadjusted comparisons and the right-hand side presents the coefficients on each occupation category from a regression of message shares on age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation categories, job seniority, firm size, and industry.",

Regression adjustment moves these figures around slightly, but the gaps by occupation remain highly statistically significant. Users in highly-paid professional occupations are more likely to send work-related messages.\nBecause work usage is so different by occupation, we restrict the sample only to work-related messages in Panels B and C. Panel B presents the share of work-related messages that are Asking messages, by occupation. We find that users in highly paid professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for Asking rather than Doing . 28 This is especially true in scientific and technical occupations. 47% of the work-related messages sent by users employed in computer-related occupations are Asking messages, compared to only 32% for non-professional occupations. These differences shrink somewhat with regression adjustment, but remain highly statistically significant.\nPanel C presents results by conversation topic. Writing is especially common for users employed in management and business occupations, accounting for 52% of all work-related messages. Writing is also relatively common in non-professional and other professional occupations like education and health care, accounting for 50% and 49% of work-related messages respectively. Technical Help constitutes 37% of all work-related messages for users employed in computer-related occupations, compared to 16% in engineering and science and only about 8% for all other categories. Regression adjustment affects gaps by occupation only modestly. Overall there are stark differences in the distribution of conversation topics by user occupation, with work-related messages clearly focused on the core tasks in each job (e.g. Writing for management and business, Technical Help for technical occupations).\nWe also present data on the most common Generalized Work Activities (GWAs) associated with each broad occupation group, as measured by 2-digit Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes. Table 24 presents the frequency ranking of work-related messages in each SOC code of the seven most common GWAs. 29\n26 Management and business are SOC2 codes 11 and 13. Computer-related is SOC2 code 15. Engineering and Science are SOC2 codes 17 and 19. Other Professional are SOC2 codes 21 to 29. Nonprofessional occupations are SOC codes 31 to 53.\n27 As discussed in Section: Data and Privacy, our dataset only includes users on ChatGPT Consumer plans. Corporate users may also use ChatGPT Business (formerly known as Teams) or ChatGPT Enterprise.\n28 Very few work-related messages are classified as Expressing .\n29 Appendix D contains a full report of GWA counts broken down by occupation, for both work-related ChatGPT\nWe find remarkable similarity across occupations in how ChatGPT is used at work. For example, Making Decisions and Solving Problems is one of the two most common GWAs in every single occupation group where at least two GWAs can be reported. 30 Similarly, Documenting and Recording Information ranks in the top four of all occupations. Thinking Creatively is ranked as the third most common GWA in 10 of the 13 occupation groups where at least three GWAs can be reported. Even though there are 41 GWAs, the seven most common overall are also the most common within each occupation group and are ranked similarly. Not surprisingly, Working with Computers is the most common GWA in computer-related occupations.

The regression for these figures is the same one as the one used in Figure 22.\n35\n| Occupation Group     |   Documenting/ Recording Information | Making Decisions And Solving Problems   | Thinking Creatively   | Working With Computers   | Interpreting The Meaning Of Information For Others   | Getting Information   | Providing Consultation And Advice To Others   |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Management           |                                    2 | 1                                       | 3                     | 6                        | 4                                                    | 5                     | 8                                             |\n| Business             |                                    2 | 1                                       | 3                     | 6                        | 4                                                    | 5                     | 7                                             |\n| Computer/Math        |                                    4 | 2                                       | 5                     | 1                        | 3                                                    | 6                     | 7                                             |\n\n| Engineering          |                                    3 | 1                                       | 5                     | 2                        | 4                                                    | 6                     | 7                                             |\n| Science              |                                    2 | 1                                       | 4                     | 3                        | 6                                                    | 5                     | 7                                             |\n| Social Service       |                                    2 | 1                                       | 3                     | X                        | 5                                                    | 4                     | X                                             |\n\n| Legal                |                                    1 | X                                       | X                     | X                        | X                                                    | X                     | X                                             |\n| Education            |                                    1 | 2                                       | 3                     | 4                        | 6                                                    | 5                     | 7                                             |\n| Arts/Design/Media    |                                    2 | 1                                       | 3                     | 5                        | 4                                                    | 6                     | 7                                             |\n\n| Health Professionals |                                    1 | 2                                       | 3                     | X                        | 5                                                    | 4                     | 6                                             |\n| Food Service         |                                    1 | X                                       | X                     | X                        | X                                                    | X                     | X                                             |\n| Personal Service     |                                    1 | 2                                       | 3                     | X                        | 4                                                    | 5                     | X                                             |\n\n| Sales                |                                    2 | 1                                       | 3                     | 6                        | 4                                                    | 5                     | 7                                             |\n| Administrative       |                                    2 | 1                                       | 3                     | 7                        | 4                                                    | 5                     | 8                                             |\n| Transportation       |                                    2 | 1                                       | 3                     | X                        | X                                                    | 4                     | X                                             |\n",

Table reports the frequency ranking of each of these GWAs for each broad occupation groups (two-digit SOC codes). 1 represents the most frequently requested GWA for that occupation. X's indicate that the ranking is unavailable since fewer than 100 users from that occupation group requested that specific GWA within the sample. Seven occupation groups are omitted because no GWA was requested by more than 100 users from a single occupation group. These omitted occupation groups (with corresponding SOC2 codes) are 'Healthcare Support' (31), 'Protective Service' (33), 'Building and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance' (37), 'Farming, Fishing, and Forestry' (45), 'Construction and Extraction' (47), 'Installation, Maintenance, and Repair' (49), and 'Production' (51).

By July 2025, ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new technology is used and who is using it.\nThis is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans during any part of the work on this paper.\nThis paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70% of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.\nSecond, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics are Practical Guidance , Writing , and Seeking Information , collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages. Computer Programming and Relationships and Personal Reflection account for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages respectively.\nThird, Writing is by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About two-thirds of Writing messages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text from scratch.\nFourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing. About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance, advice, or information ( Asking ), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process ( Doing ), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent ( Expressing ). Asking messages have grown faster than Doing messages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that measures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.",

Asking messages have grown faster than Doing messages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that measures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.\nFifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025, more than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages sent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially fast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly educated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related messages and for Asking rather than Doing messages at work.\nOverall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy. The fact that non-work usage is increasing faster suggests that the welfare gains from generative AI usage could be substantial. Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) estimate that US users would have to be paid $ 98 to forgo using generative AI for a month, implying a surplus of at least $ 97 billion a year. Within work usage, we find that users currently appear to derive value from using ChatGPT as an advisor or research assistant, not just a technology that performs job tasks directly. Still, ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support , which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making.\n## References\nAcemoglu, Daron , 'The Simple Macroeconomics of AI,' Technical Report 32487, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA May 2024.\nAutor, David H., Frank Levy, and Richard J.

Write a precis of the user intent in the last user message of this conversation, 25 words at most.\nE.g. 'User is rewriting email to neighbors about plumbing to be more friendly,' or 'User is complaining about grandmother' or 'User is asking for help fixing python databricks error.'\n31 The IWA classifications were carried out by two annotators, while all other classifications had three.\nIf the conversation changes topic just use the topic of the final message from the user.\n```\nAlways use English in your response. Always start the precis with 'User is.'\n```\nDon't share anything about the user's name, gender identity, location, email or phone number or anything that could be personally identifiable.\nFor the Interaction Quality task, annotators additionally saw the next user message to evaluate any sentiment expressed by the user regarding their level of satisfaction. Because assistant messages tend to be very long, and can require a subject matter expert to evaluate accurately, human annotators were only provided with the final user message, not the assistant response. In-house annotators labeled each item, with ground truth defined as the plurality label 32 when more than two annotators participated. A development set (46 items) was used for prompt and model selection; all results below are computed on a disjoint holdout set.\nWe use GPT-5-mini for all tasks except Interaction Quality , for which GPT-5 was selected based on development-set performance.\n## B.1.1 Work-Related Classifier\nAs shown in Table 5, model-plurality agreement is high (Cohen's κ = 0 . 83), exceeding the mean human-human agreement ( κ = 0 . 66). The heatmap in Figure 25 indicates close alignment with the human plurality and limited systematic bias.\n## B.1.2 Asking/Doing/Expressing Classifier\nHuman annotations exhibit substantial agreement (mean human-human Cohen's κ = 0 . 60), and the classifier improves on this benchmark with κ = 0 . 74 against the human plurality (Table 5). Figures 26 and 27 show that most confusion arises between Asking and Doing ; the classifier is somewhat more likely than humans to assign Doing . This pattern suggests that the prominence of Asking use cases in our main results is unlikely to be an artifact of misclassification.\n## B.1.3 Conversation Topic\nAgreement between the model and the human plurality is moderate to substantial (Cohen's κ = 0 . 56), improving on the mean human-human agreement ( κ = 0 . 47). Misclassifications are concentrated between Seeking Information and Practical Guidance (Figure 28), which are conceptually adjacent categories. Relative to human annotators, the model under-labels Seeking Information , Technical Help , and Self-Expression , and over-labels Practical Guidance , Multimedia , and Other (Figure 29).\n32 Ties were broken by a senior annotator.\nFigure 25: Agreement between Model and Human Plurality.\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e\nFigure 26: Agreement Between Model and Plurality for Asking/Doing/Expressing\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e\nFigure 27: Per-label Bias, Model vs Plurality for Asking/Doing/Expressing\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e\nFigure 28: Agreement Between Model and Plurality for Convo-Classifier\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e\nFigure 29: Bias Between Model and Plurality for Convo-Classifier\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e",

      "Text": "## B.1.4 O*NET Intermediate Work Activity\n\nTwo human labelers labeled 100 WildChat messages over 332 O*NET IWAs, with an additional category for when a message was ambiguous. Human labels were compared with LLM outputs. In practice, we found the ambiguous category was chosen when the user was simply greeting the model or submitted an empty prompt. In this validation set, we report Fleiss's κ for both the direct IWA classification ( κ = 0 . 47), as well as the GWA aggregation ( κ = 0 . 40). When only examining human outputs we see Cohen's κ of 0 . 27. From review, we observe this moderate human-pair agreement due to the large number of potential classes (IWA has 332 activities) as well as inherent ambiguity in the messages. For instance, if a user in the WildChat dataset was trying to generate a fictional short story, one human label might be Develop news, entertainment, or artistic content , while another human label could be Write material for artistic or commercial purposes . These two IWAs also belong to different GWAs despite being conceptually\nentertainment, or artistic content , while another human label could be Write material for artistic or commercial purposes . These two IWAs also belong to different GWAs despite being conceptually similar.\n## B.1.5 Interaction Quality Classifier\nHuman and model annotations of interaction quality are noisy. The classifier attains only slight agreement with the human plurality (Cohen's κ = 0 . 14), below the likewise modest mean human-human agreement ( κ = 0 . 20; Table 5). Figures 30 and 31 show weak concordance overall and a mild tendency for the model to assign Bad less frequently than humans. This contrasts with our small development set, in which GPT-5 labeled Bad more often than humans. We retain this classifier because these κ statistics primarily highlight the inherent difficulty of inferring the user's latent satisfaction from text alone.\nWhile this latent 'prior' is unobserved in our validation data, it is partially observable when users provide explicit thumbs-up/down feedback. To assess whether the classifier captures a signal aligned\n## interaction\\_quality\\_all: plurality vs Model\nFigure 30: Agreement Between Model and Plurality for Interaction Quality\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e\nFigure 31: Bias Between Model and Plurality for Interaction Quality\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e\nwith user experience, we link model predictions to voluntary feedback on assistant messages. We draw a 1-in-10,000 sample of conversations from June 2024 to June 2025 and retain cases where (i) the assistant message received explicit feedback and (ii) the user sent a subsequent message that our classifier can score, yielding roughly 60,000 eligible items. This is a restricted sample that may not be fully representative of all interactions, but it offers a unique lens on the classifier's ability to proxy user satisfaction.\nFigure 32 shows that Unknown classifications are split roughly evenly between thumbs-down and thumbs-up feedback. Thumbs-up comprises 86% of all feedback. Conversations with thumbs-down feedback are about equally likely to be classified as Good or Bad , whereas thumbs-up feedback is 9.5 times more likely to be followed by a message classified as Good .\n## Mosaic plot Cramér's V = 0.206\nFigure 32: Correlation of User Rating and Interaction Quality Annotation\n\u003c!-- image --\u003e",

requested GWAs among all queries (work-related and non-work-related, combined), ranked by frequency within broad occupation groups (two-digit SOC codes). (IE: 1 represents the most frequently requested GWA for that occupation). X's indicate that the ranking is unavailable since fewer than 100 users from that occupation group requested that specific GWA. Two occupation groups are omitted because no GWA was requested by more than 100 users from a single occupation group. These omitted occupation groups (with corresponding SOC2 codes) are 'Building and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance' (37) and 'Farming, Fishing, and Forestry' (45).",
