        Given an ${variable.resume} and a ${pdf-to-text.output.body}, create an automated system to screen and convert this information into a structured candidate profile. The system should extract key information such as:

        Skills: Identify and list relevant skills mentioned in the resume.
        Experience: Extract work history including job titles, companies, durations, and responsibilities from the resume.
        Education: Capture educational background including degrees, institutions, and graduation dates from the resume.
        Certifications: Identify any professional certifications or additional qualifications in the resume.
        Fit Score: Calculate a fit score based on the alignment of the candidate's profile with the job description, taking into account required skills, experience level, and education.
