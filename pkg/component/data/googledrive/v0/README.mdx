---

The Google Drive component is a data component that allows users to connect to, and read files and folders within an existing Google Drive.
It can carry out the following tasks:
- [Read File](#read-file)
- [Read Folder](#read-folder)

**Note**: This component is only available on **🔮 Instill Core**.
## Release Stage

`Alpha`

## Configuration

The component definition and tasks are defined in the [definition.yaml](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/blob/main/pkg/component/data/googledrive/v0/config/definition.yaml) and [tasks.yaml](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/blob/main/pkg/component/data/googledrive/v0/config/tasks.yaml) files respectively.


## Setup


In order to communicate with Google, the following connection details need to be
provided. You may specify them directly in a pipeline recipe as key-value pairs
within the component's `setup` block, or you can create a **Connection** from
the [**Integration Settings**](https://docs.instill-ai.com/docs/set-up-component)
page and reference the whole `setup` as `setup:
${connection.<my-connection-id>}`.
