To use Artifact Component, you will need to set up the OpenAI API key for self-hosted deployment of Instill Core.
You can do this by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
Please refer to [configuring-the-embedding-feature](https://docs.instill-ai.com/docs/configuration#/configure-the-embedding-feature)
p.s. In Instill Cloud case, you do not need to set up the OpenAI API key.
